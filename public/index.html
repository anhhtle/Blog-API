                    Just look what it's done to you. One day, you will perish. You will like with the rest of your kind in the dirt.
                    Your dreams forgotten, your horrors faced, your muscles will turn to sand, and upon that sand a new God will walk,
                    one that will never die, because this world doesn't belong to you or the people who came before. It belongs to someone who is yet to come.</p>
